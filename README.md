# IntellHexParser

intelHexParser.py is the main file used to parse pic32 image. The rest are examples using the parser.The parser has some conveniance functions which you can read in the file itself.
i can not guarantee that everything works without any bugs, but in the year I used it, I corrected all the bugs I encountered. I used it to embed a bootloader image in the application as a c file containing an array of bytes, so it can be written within the application itself and used for updating the existing bootloader. Also I needed the parser to calculate an image CRC32 and write it to a Firmware descriptor defined in an application. You may use all this software as without restrictions.
